### Mexico Inflation Calculator

A simple program to determine inflation between two periods.

When run, it will automatically display the last value in Mexican Consumer Price Index (INPC) and will prompt for two dates from the user. 

The program will then retreive the monthly index values during the period and calculate the inflation between the two dates.

Output will display the inflation for the period, as well as the Index values of the period.

### Use cases
The progam is usefull to quickly adjust rent prices, a stock's cost basis or any asset value that is periodically adjusted for inflation. 

To run the program, a free API token is required from INEGI (National Statistics and Geography Institute) and can be obtained here:
[INEGI](https://www.inegi.org.mx/servicios/api_indicadores_1.0.html#token)


### Instalation
Simply run the python code from a terminal. 


### Contributing
If you can help making this a simple executable file for windows and mac, so non programers can use it, it would be much appreciated. 

Any GUI development would also be very helpful.
